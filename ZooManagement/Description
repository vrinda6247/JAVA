Implemented a Zoo Management System where all the animals will be allocated to zones based on their characteristics. 

The Zoo Management System will have multiple zones and each zone would support animals from a single category like mammal, reptile or bird.
There could be multiple zones for the same category. Each zone will have cages for animals. Each zone has a limit on the number of cages
that can be added to the zone. A zone could have additional attributes like hasPark, hasCanteen etc.

Each cage will specify the type of animals that can be added to the cage, and will have a limit on the number of animals that can 
be added to the cage.

When a new animal is added to the zoo, it will be allocated to an existing cage if there is available capacity. Otherwise a new cage will
need to be added. 

Each animal will have a unique name, and will have attributes like age, weight etc. It will support methods like getSound() which returns
a string representing the sound corresponding to that animal type, like for a lion it should return “roars”.
